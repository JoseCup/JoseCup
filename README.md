Hello! 

My name is Jose Cupido and I am a Comp Sci major at the University of Memphis. In my free time, I enjoy honing my programming skills on LeetCode and studying data structures. I also like building cool websites for my freelance business, CreateDev Crew! I am currently studying C-suite and learning more about web apps with Python and Javascript in my final semester. 

My current projects include:
Web scrapers with beautifulSoup (mostly for SEO purposes)
Game simulators (text story based)
An HTML5 2D game (using Phaser.io)
I'm also developing a syllabus/program for an online school system where students can get a more guided, 
yet reasonably rigorous experience in learning about programming. If you are interested in help or have a 
similar goal, lets team up!
